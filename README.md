## About

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve programming puzzles for each day of December leading up to Christmas.

## Usage

Code is written in Java and needs [Java jdk](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-and-install-java-development-kit-jdk-on-windows-mac-and-linux/) installed and ready to run.

Option 1:
Once Java jdk is setup, open the project in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). In VSCode navigate to .vscode/launch.json file and change in args which day and which problem you would like to run.
For Example (year 2024, day 3, part 2):
```
...
  "args": [
      "2024", // year number
      "3",    // day number
      "2",    // part number
  ],
...
```

Option 2:
Once Java jdk is setup, go to the root of project and open the terminal and run:
```
javac Main.java
javac year[year number]\day[number of day in two digits. e.g. 02 for day 2 or 14 for day 14]\Part[1/2].java
java Main [year number] [day] [part]
```
